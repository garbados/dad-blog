          <p>On Nov 10 2017 I said:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>No one needs to starve. No one needs to freeze. No one needs to die. There is enough for everyone. More empty homes than all the people without them, more food than grocers can even sell. The labor and the materials to end scarcity exist now. It is not a far-off dream. We can end scarcity in this life. <a href="https://toot.cat/@garbados/3097461">(link)</a></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Some folks have pointed out that there are not infinite televisions, and so I cannot feasibly &quot;end scarcity&quot; because I cannot create matter or energy. That&#39;s not what scarcity is to me.</p>
          <p>Scarcity is standing hungry with your kid at the grocer&#39;s door knowing they will just throw out what they cannot sell, but they will lock the bins to keep you out. You could just take it. They would just throw it out. The conflict hurts worse than the hunger.</p>
          <p>Scarcity is losing your job and your roof to neurodivergence and freezing to death outside perfectly warm, entirely empty homes because without rent, landlords call the cops. Cops shoot people like you.</p>
          <p>Scarcity is the rich saying they earned their inheritance while you earned starvation.</p>
          <p>That scarcity is artificial. We can make sure that such fates befall no one. No one needs to die.</p>
          <p>Some other folks then asked, &quot;OK, but, how?&quot; The juxtaposition of plenty beside deprivation suggests that the problem is logistical: for whatever reason, our material supply systems cannot correctly apportion goods and services to those who need them. It is not a market problem; markets as institutions have failed for centuries to resolve this problem. Even as the supply of things has grown beyond our ancestors&#39; wildest expectations, the people pointlessly go without. We can do better.</p>
          <p>OK, <strong>but how?</strong> As the comrades say, we must seize the means of production. We have to think, as communities, the way that nations think about food security, energy security, the maintenance of our infrastructure, and one another&#39;s welfare. Folks often think of governments as being responsible for essential services like water and electricity, but when the reality is that the governments who claim to own where you live do not provide those essential services, they don&#39;t become less essential. We must provide these things for each other or perish. That&#39;s the nature of essential services, y&#39;all.</p>
          <p>It&#39;s sometimes hard for me to articulate to those who don&#39;t live it what mutual aid means. For years now, informal systems of direct material support have kept me alive. When the FDA fucked up the paperwork and created a shortage of estrogen while the meds sat in warehouses ready to ship, trans women shared their personal backstocks with one another to minimize the disruption. I have been fed, housed, treated, and healed by my sisters. Reality for many of us is already post-capitalist, because that dying institution does not facilitate our survival. It only bars it. Only post-capitalist systems like mutual aid have kept us alive. No matter how far back in history I look, through the worst our enemies have had to offer, it is how we have kept each other alive.</p>
          <p>Mutual aid doesn&#39;t have to provide for everyone all at once to function. We can provide for each other as we&#39;ve done, and scale these systems within our communities. We can share our methods and our tools, share knowledge and histories, until no one fears the landlord, the cop, the politician, the boss, or the blue-blood. Until all communities, all people, experience a plenty of their own design.</p>
          <p>Everyone I know is either overworked or {un,under}employed. Capitalism sloughs lives and calls it efficiency, and uses the surplus to burn out those it keeps. It&#39;s not the machines that want to replace us, it&#39;s the capitalists. That surplus labor, that is the combined abilities of the excluded, represents more than enough to scale these shadow economies to provide for everyone. The capital is superfluous; the labor and the materials already exist. Tomorrow is ours for the taking if we can take it together. We can. We will. We are.</p>
          <p>There is nothing to wait for. No signal. No turning point. Tomorrow is coming and we will need food just like yesterday. We will need to defend ourselves, just like yesterday. We will do our best, just like yesterday. Just like yesterday, we will make it together.</p>
