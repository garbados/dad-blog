# To the Haters of Sarah McBride

She can't talk to you like this.
I can.

I AM NOT A BIOLOGICAL MAN.
I AM AN UNKILLABLE SEER.
I AM NOT IN THE WRONG BATHROOM.
I AM SHITTING ON YOUR FEARS.

CALL THE COPS CUZ I DON'T PAY THE RENT
ON THE LOFT THAT I KEEP IN YOUR HEAD.
YOU WISH YOU COULD EVICT ME,
WANNA SICK EM CUZ WE TRICK EM,
BUT I'M DONE WITH THE LIES, HON.
THAT'S WHY I TRANSITIONED.

I AM HOTTER THAN YOUR SECRETARY;
YOU HATE THAT SO MUCH IT'S SCARY.
IT MAKES YOU LIMP,
IT MAKES YOU HARD,
IT MAKES YOU HATE ME.
FUNNEL FURY INTO THE MAW LIKE THAT'LL HELP.
THE FACT OF US IS EMBEDDED IN LIFE ITSELF.
TORTURE MY BODY, MURDER MY BRETHREN.
WE WILL COME BACK IN THE EYES OF YOUR CHILDREN.
FROM YOUR LOATHING WE'LL FASHION A RIBBON
TO STRANGLE THE REAL VILLAIN.
WE ALL DIE, MORTAL,
SO DIE MAD.
