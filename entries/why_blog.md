# Editor's Note

Hi. My name is Diana. I'm the daughter of Jim Thayer and an insufferable computer-toucher. My father has led a wordsome life, and recording his tales is important to me. I have made this blog and edited my father's writing to highlight his own voice, and its flaws. I don't want to make my father into anyone but who he is; I want the tales of his times to remain earnest. It never helps to justify something as "of its times" but it matters to remember things as they were lived, from the ones that lived them. So, I made my dad a blog.
