# Let's begin.

This is a new entry.

I recently drafted the [thick-blog](https://github.com/garbados/thick-blog) as an intentional precursor to managing my own blog. I haven't had a formal, public blog in a few years, but there have been threads on Mastodon that I've wanted to expand or expound upon. That's largely what this blog is for.

Anyway: my name is Diana. I make software but not very well. I've been writing software since 2009, when I started writing web scrapers in Python. Now I write JavaScript for the most part because browsers are the new JVM. I make things to rebuild and retake the web.

After spending some years in Boston as a developer evangelist for a handful of startups, I burned out in 2013 as I was coming out, and spent a few years more or less catatonic. I felt like I had woken up to a world that wanted to kill everyone I loved, that had been killing them for thousands of years. A few friends have been murdered. A few murdered themselves. I think the kyriarchy killed them all. I'm back on my feet now and more resolved than ever that we will kill the kyriarchy. No one needs to starve or freeze or die. We can all live without fear.

I believe we can reach that world without fear within this life, but it's going to take some damn hard work. I want to talk about the work that I see happening, the work that I'm doing, and the work that remains undone.

I believe in you. I believe in us. We will make it, together.
